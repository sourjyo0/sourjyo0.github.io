<p>#Go and Networking A book is already procured although I will find an appropriate project to use it in later… jse.li has given a good intro to the concept. #HTB.eu Some work is already done. I will check back to use the first box and review. #Computerphile Cryptography This is aboout as likely as me watching 3b1b i can’t even remember the last time i was excited by anything math related or academic related. I don’t know when my fire died but I will have to re-kindle that fire. Or be a business analyst making money and dying. I don’t know. I hope I do something other than not being present and chasing material pleasures. I have to stop getting into funnels. How do I solve my discipline problem which has been plaguing me for the past 4 years?It looks like I have become something that can’t even function properly. #Math used in LearnAIFromScratch #Riot #Math - AMC8 aops #Unity Some expertise is already gained although the scripting part remains to be seen.Hopeful that the physics can be made more understandable. #Arduino Books and Hardware are already present,however it will take some additional training to create a working prototype,along with the UI. #MDN The WEB API seems doable although frameworks are seeming to be more of a genuine concern. It is highly unlikely that I will learn any framework as it is unclear to me what their real use is other than bloating up the web which is something I hate.Even if I make bloat free alternatives to popular sites, they will not be modular to give a “seamless app like experience” that modern web app people think the web should look like. Thinking about Next.js and Svelte and React + Native and also #Various “unrelated” competitions and courses on FunctionalCS #Continuation on Haskell, #Homotopy,Group and Game Theory, Physics, Geometry etc bollu #Kaggle competition regarding CNN and also fast.ai #OpenAI RL Spinning up , AlphaZero and MCTS methods #ccxt This has made the most progress as there is some important trading algos to be implemented in a Kaggle nb Quickfingersluc needs to be checked out as well as The quant strategies list and make some charts if nothing else #flowstate #quantum_computer_girl_vid #Meditate #julia * Fiction Books - A Woman of No Importance -Oscar Wilde - Ayode on Ayode:A cinematic odessy - And the mountains echoed - Scream 2 - The name of the rose - Umberto Eco - the four agreements - a guide to a personal freedom - A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</p>
<p>#What makes a good life - a good sleep schedule - control over one’s life - health and ability to do things - time management(don’t be too free. be aware of your limitations) - accept that life will never be “stable” and just do what you can - do not open phone or computer for entertainment purposes(have alternative ent. sources) - stare at the wall and go upstairs - don’t get mad but what if you’re annoyed just deal with it ??? - read some books and make notes? - i don’t need a constant source of entertainment - i don’t need a constant source of buying things - i don’t have any materialistic life goals i.e i dont want a boat - what i want is sleep and food to complement that sleep - Habits - daily habit tracking and journalling - use vimwiki diary and cal along with calc - instead of findian a video for broad topics like life advice,ask a better question(#1 rule of googling/searching) - use weekly and daily goals to make your life easier - execute well - talk to your friends and ask them about themselves - stop making impulse decisions about tasks surfing and eating. you should know what you eat tmrw.</p>
